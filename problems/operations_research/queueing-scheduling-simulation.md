## Q345. Consider N unit-speed servers with processor sharing: a server divides its capac…

**Status:** Open · **Kind:** conjecture (Conjecture 4.2) · **Collection** 4

Consider N unit-speed servers with processor sharing: a server divides its capacity equally among its unfinished replicas. Jobs arrive as a Poisson process of rate λ. Each job independently chooses d distinct servers uniformly, 1 ≤ d ≤ N, and places one replica at each. Its service requirements (X₁,…,X_d) have an arbitrary fixed joint distribution, with identical nonnegative marginals X satisfying 0 < E[X] < ∞; vectors are independent across jobs and independent of arrivals and assignments. Replicas are cancelled immediately when the first finishes. Does λ d E[min(X₁,…,X_d)] < N imply stability of the stochastic system, i.e. positive recurrence of the full queueing state process (including service requirements or attained service), rather than merely stability of its fluid model? For nonexchangeable replica laws, assign replica labels uniformly to the selected servers.

## Q654. Can expiring computation opportunities beat the LP barrier?

**Status:** Open · **Kind:** open problem · **Collection** 7

All n options are initially available. Option j has known value v_j>0 and mutually independent integer processing/expiration times S_j,E_j with known laws. One processor selects an available option, runs it nonpreemptively, earns v_j and may repeat; a started option cannot expire. Can a polynomial-time adaptive policy beat ratio 1−1/e against the optimal nonanticipating policy, or is that a computational barrier? Use the explicitly bounded time-support input model, without claiming strong polynomiality in a binary-encoded horizon.

**Context.** Attribution: §6 asks to surpass the LP barrier using stronger methods.

## Q657. Variance-independent sublinear-machine approximation for general jobs

**Status:** Open · **Kind:** open problem · **Collection** 7

For n independent nonnegative jobs on m identical machines with known finite-support processing laws, can a polynomial-time adaptive approximation to minimum E[Σ\_j C_j] have sublinear m dependence independent of processing-time variances? Jobs are nonpreemptive, reveal duration through execution, and must all finish. Extend the Bernoulli Õ(√m) guarantee to general laws, displaying any polylog(n) factors explicitly; such factors must not be mistaken for a uniform o(m) ratio.

**Context.** Doctoral connection: Rudy Zhou; dissertation and supervision listed under question 655. Attribution: The joint SODA paper and Zhou’s thesis explicitly identify this extension.

## Q3094. Uniqueness of the overloaded zero-initial-state reneging fluid model

**Status:** Open · **Kind:** open problem · **Collection** 31

Is there exactly one such path for every allowed parameter choice?

**Context.** Origin for question 3094: Unresolved exceptional case identified in the thesis and retained in the 2025 joint journal paper. Setup for question 3094: Fix integers J≥2,K≥1, α\_j,μ\_j>0, p_j∈(0,1), ∑p_j=1, and probability measures θ\_j on [0,∞) with θ\_j({0})=0. Assume ρ=∑α\_j/(Kμ\_j)>1. Seek weakly continuous finite nonnegative measure paths ζ\_j(t), initially zero, with ζ\_j(t)({0})=0 and L(t)=∑(p_j/μ\_j)ζ\_j(t)([0,∞))>0 for t>0, satisfying, for every f∈C_b¹([0,∞)) with f(0)=0, ⟨f,ζ\_j(t)⟩=−∫₀ᵗ⟨f′,ζ\_j(s)⟩ds−Kp_j∫₀ᵗ⟨f,ζ\_j(s)⟩/L(s)ds+α\_jt⟨f,θ\_j⟩.

## Q3095. Asymptotic optimality of GRAND(0) packing

**Status:** Open · **Kind:** conjecture (Conjecture 10) · **Collection** 31

Does dist(x^r,X\*) converge in probability to zero as r→∞?

**Context.** Origin for question 3095: Original 2015 conjecture explicitly retained in the 2025 ranked-server paper. Setup for question 3095: Fix I≥1 and a finite coordinatewise downward-closed set K̄⊂Z_+^I containing 0,e₁,…,e_I; set K=K̄\\{0}. Type-i arrivals are independent Poisson of rate rλ\_i; independent service times are Exp(μ\_i), with λ\_i,μ\_i>0 and ∑λ\_i/μ\_i=1. Infinitely many servers allow configurations in K̄. An arrival chooses uniformly among occupied servers that can accommodate it, opening a new server only if none can; no migration occurs. In stationarity x_k^r is the number of servers in configuration k divided by r. Let X\* minimize ∑\_K x_k over x≥0 with ∑\_K k_i x_k=λ\_i/μ\_i for every i.
